# How do I find what achievements my students have earned?

Once you have created achievements and have your students set to participate in them, you can track the achievements they are earning from either a user's Profile or from the Find Achievements page. 

To access the achievements of a student:
1. On the **User Profile** page, click **Achievements** in the toolbar. This opens a page displaying all achievements the user has earned. This link is only available if your organization has achievements AND the user is participating.

To track who has earned a specific achievement, use the **Find Users** search page. On this page:
1. From the **Add filter** dropdown, add the **Achievement** filter.
1. In the **Choose Achievement** dialog, select the achievement you want and click **OK**. All of your users who have earned the achievement will be listed in the results.
