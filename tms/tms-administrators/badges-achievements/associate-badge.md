# How do I associate a badge with an achievement?

Achievements contain the conditions a user must meet through their training activities to earn an award and the badge associated with it. The following settings must be in place for the user to earn an achievement and badge:

1. Your organization must have the **Enable Achievements** field checked on the **Preferences** tab. This enables your users to earn achievements.
1. A user must have the **Participate in Achievements** field checked on the **Basic Information** tab of their profile.
1. The achievement must belong to the organization the user belongs to OR the course must have the **Enable achievements for outside organizations** checked.

You can either associate a badge with an existing achievement or create a new achievement and associate the badge (see [How do I create an achievement?](create-achievements-to-motivate-learners.md)).

To associate the badge with the achievement,
1. In the **Create/Edit Achievement** page for the achievement you want to use to earn the badge, click **Choose** next to the **Badge** field.
1. In the **Choose Badge** dialog, search for and select the badge and click **OK**.
1. Click **Save**.

When a user earns the achievement, Credly is automatically notified that the user has earned the associated badge. The user will receive an email from Credly containing instructions on how to accept and share the badge.

> [!ALERT] For Credly, a badge template may be configured to allow a user to only earn one badge per badge template. Users are identified by their email addresses, and the address must follow valid email guidelines or the badge will not be earned.
