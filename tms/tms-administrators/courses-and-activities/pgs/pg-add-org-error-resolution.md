# How do I find what courses belong to a publishing group?

When you have received the **[The organization] cannot be added because it already has access to one or more of the courses within the group from another Publishing Group.** error message and need to find the courses in this publishing group that the organization already has access to and through which publishing group that access was granted, you can use a combination of search pages. 

To do this: 
 1. On the **Admin** menu in the **Courses** group, click **Find Courses**. This will bring up the Find Courses search page. 
 1. Click the **Add filter** dropdown.
 1. Select the **Publishing Group (Choose)** appropriate filter(s). 
 1. In the **Choose Publishing Group** dialog, search for and select the course and click **OK**.
 1. Click **Search**. The search results will list all of the courses in that publishing group.
 1. Export the results.
 1. For each course, use the steps in the [How do I find what organizations have access to a course through other publishing groups?](pg-add-pg-error-resolution.md) article to cross-check where this organization already may have access to it.
