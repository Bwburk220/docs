# How do I find what organizations have access to a course through other publishing groups?

When you have received the **[The publishing group] cannot be added because one or more organizations already have access through an existing Publishing Group.** error message and need to find the organizations that have access to the course, you can use the Find Publishing Groups search page.

1. Click the **Add filter** dropdown.
1. Select the **Course (Choose)** filter. 
1. In the **Choose Course** dialog, search for and select the course and click **OK**.
1. Click **Search**. The search results will list the all the publishing groups that contain that course. 
1. Next to each publishing group, click **Details** to the right of it to open the **Publishing Group** profile page. 
1. Under the **Published Organizations** section, review the organizations who have access to the course through that publishing group.
